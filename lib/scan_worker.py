"""Side-effect-free metadata extraction worker for the library scan.

This module is deliberately kept apart from ``server.py`` so that
``ProcessPoolExecutor`` workers can import and unpickle ``_scan_one``
without dragging in ``server.py``'s import-time side effects
(``configure_logging()``, ``meta_db = MetadataDB()`` opening/migrating
SQLite, and ``register_plugin_api(app)`` registering routes).

The background scan spawns its pool with the ``spawn`` start method (see
``server._background_scan``), so each worker is a fresh interpreter that
imports only this module plus the pure ``lib`` helpers below — never the
whole server. That avoids two problems flagged in review:

* forking a ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` from the non-main scan thread (the
  default on Linux), which can deadlock on locks held by other threads at
  fork time; and
* re-running ``server.py``'s side effects in every worker on ``spawn``
  platforms (macOS/Windows), which would reopen SQLite per worker and let
  a multi-process ``RotatingFileHandler`` corrupt the log file.

It also means the per-file ``log.debug`` below simply no-ops inside
workers (logging is unconfigured there), which is the desired behaviour —
worker log records never reach the shared log file.
