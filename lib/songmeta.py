"""Persist user-edited song metadata back into the underlying song file.

The library scanner (`lib/scan_worker.py`) re-derives title/artist/album/year
from the file on every full rescan — from the sloppak ``manifest.yaml``
top-level keys. A DB-only edit therefore reverts the moment a full rescan
re-reads the file. Writing the edit into the file makes the file the single
source of truth, so the change survives both incremental and full rescans.

``fields`` is a partial dict of any of ``title``/``artist``/``album``/``year``;
only the keys present are overwritten, so an edit of just the title can't blank
out the artist.

Only feedBack's own song-package format (zip- or directory-form, ``.feedpak``
or the legacy ``.sloppak`` suffix) is writable. Unknown / unsupported shapes
return False and the caller keeps the DB-only update.
